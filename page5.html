	<p> Although this is not my cat I would have to say that this is one of the cutest videos I have ever seen. However I have to say that we have caught my cat sleeping in weird places too many times to count. </p>

	<p> Unfortunately Sophie had just woken up as we were taking the photo, but as you can see she fell asleep in this position. I dont know about you, but this does not look comfortable to me. This is also not the most flattering photo of her but a cute one none the less. </p>

	<p> It was in this napkin basket that we found my cat after searching for her for 30 minutes. Our calling out her name must have woken her up but she was very warm indicating she had just woken up from her hourly nap. </p>

	<p> Finally this is one of her most common sleeping spots. It is on the door mat infront of our deck doors. This provides Sophie with warm sun, and even a small rug for her to lay on. I honestly think she could fall asleep anywhere. </p>
