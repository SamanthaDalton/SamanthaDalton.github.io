<p> This photo was taken on August 30th, and as you can see, Sophie started out her day by finding the freshly opened can of cat food that had been left on the counter and devouring the entire thing. She seemed pretty pleased with herself!</p>

<p> After her mighty feast, Sophie proceeded to the napkins on the kitchen table for her nap (I know, comfortable right!). This typically goes on for the rest of the day until someone gets home and feeds her again.</p>
