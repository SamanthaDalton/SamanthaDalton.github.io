	<p> "If I fits I sits" is a term my household has used a lot throughout the three years we've had Sophie. This is because if there is a new object brought into the house, she must identify that object by either sitting on it or in it. Some of the things she has managed to squeeze herself into are actually really funny... </p>

	<p> This photo was taken this past Easter. After waking up and having a yummy Easter breakfast, my mom brought down this basket that Sophie had never seen before. Because she is so curious, she had to figure out what this new thing was, and so she decided to sit in it and try to eat some of the little, fake grass. </p>

	<p> This is Sophie's brother, Lynx. He is my cousin's cat that she got around the same time. Clearly, he knows this concept as well. </p>
