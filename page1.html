<p>Welcome to my website, if you like cats this is the place to go! Being in college I currently have to leave my cat Sophie at home, however this website will be a good way for me to keep up with my cats and post current pictures of her. On this homepage you can find a link to the University of Maine website, and to the other pages of this website.</p>
