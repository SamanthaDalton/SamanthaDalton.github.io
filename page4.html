		<p> "Hide and Seek" is one of Sophie's favorite games to play. I know this sounds weird considering she's a cat, but it's like she really knows how to play the game! Sometimes, we'll look for her for several minutes, calling out for her, before she'll pop up from behind something random. Exhibit A: These curtains. </p>

		<p> Exhibit B: Under the covers.  </P>

		<p> Finally, Exhibit C: Behind the curtains again. I personally thought this one was cute because her tail is sticking out. </p>
