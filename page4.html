		<p> Hide and seek is one of Sophie's favorite games to play. I know this sounds weird considering she is a cat, but it is like she actually knows how to play the game. We will be looking for her for several minutes calling out for her before she will pop up from behind something random. Exhibit A: These curtains. </p>

		<p> Finally....Exhibit C: Behind the curtains again. I personally thought this one was cute because her tail is sticking out </p>
